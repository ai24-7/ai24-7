Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the data science position at your company, as I am confident that my skills and experience align with the requirements of the role. As a data analyst with academic background in economics and years of experience, I am proficient in data science and have extensive knowledge of statistics and mathematics.

I completed my master's paper on the economic impact of euro adoption on small open economies, using synthetic control method. Working on this paper allows me to understand the theoretical concepts of machine learning and statistical analysis.

Throughout my working exprience, I learned how to define a business relevant question using mathematics, and how to utilize machine learning to solve the problem in an efficient way. I have had the opportunity to get hands-on experience with a wide range of open source tools to handle the whole life cycle of data science project. As such, I am confident to create ETL pipeline, to do EDA and feature engineering, to conduct trackable analysis based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms using cloud services, to deploy models to production utilizing best practices in devops, and to monitor and optimize the performance of these models.

As an economics graduate with a passion for data science, I am confident that I will be a valuable addition to your team. I look forward to leveraging both my knowledge in economics and machine learning to contribute to your company's goals.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Daniel Safavisohi
